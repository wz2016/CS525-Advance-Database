Description:
In the assignment 3, the record manager is created and implemented. The record manger handles tables by using tableList structure and allow clients to insert, delete, update and scan records. All the methods included in the record_mgr.c and pass all the testes in the test_assign3_1.c. In addition, out team implement an user interactive interface; the code stored in the ui.c.
Extra credit Acomplished:
1.tombstones
2.Interactive interface
(For the interractive interface, incorrect input is not handled)

How to compile and test:
1. Open terminal and go to the assign3 folder
2. type in: make (compile files)
3. type in: ./record_mgr (to test)
4. type in: make ./ui (to compile the UI)
5. type in: ./ui (to run the UI)


Design Idea:

Makefile:
Our Makefile shows dependencies among all files. If any file is modified, just run "make" again, changes will be updated.
"make clean" helps us remove unwanted files thus we can commit and push only source files to repository.
“make ./ui”  compiles ui

record_mgr.c:
part1: table and manager

part2: handling records in a table

part3: scans

part4: dealing with schemas

part5: dealing with records and attribute values
