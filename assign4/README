Description:
In the assignment 4, we inplement a tree structure which can be used to find, insert and delete key stored in the page file. In the tree, each node occupies one page and the relationship between nodes can be showed by the printTree().

How to compile and test:
1. Open terminal and go to the assign3 folder
2. type in: make (compile files)
3. type in:  ./btree_mgr(to test)


Design Idea:

Makefile:
Our Makefile shows dependencies among all files. If any file is modified, just run "make" again, changes will be updated.

"make clean" helps us remove unwanted files thus we can commit and push only source files to repository.

btree_mgr.c:
part1:
init and shutdown index manager

part2:
create, destroy, open, and close an btree index

part3:
access information about a b-tree

part4:
index access

part5:
debug and test functions
